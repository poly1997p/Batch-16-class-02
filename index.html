He was prominent form 1826 to 1895.

            During this period, many design houses hired artists. <br>Furthermore, the job of these artists was to develop innovative designs for garments. The clients would examine many different patterns. Then they would pick the one they like. Consequently, a tradition began of presenting patterns to customers and then stitching them.

        <em style="color: rgb(97, 4, 184);">The slowest fashion
        I let Fast Fashion pass me by
        I choose a slower way
        I watch the needle drop right down
        And I while away the day
        
        I choose the Slowest Fashion
        The one grandmother wore
        I now knit at the slowest pace
        With no desire for more</em>
